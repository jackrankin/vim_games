vim games!

working on boggle, some puzzles, and head to head type editing (like type racer, but vim) 

to run the backend, enter the backend directory and type `go run .`

to run the frontend, enter the frontend directory and type `http-server` (if that doesn't work you might need to use node's package manager and install http-server)
